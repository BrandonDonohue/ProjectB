# ProjectB
First project created at Texas A&amp;M in 2014. Just a simple checkers-style game made with FLTK.

*Need Xming in order to compile.*

This was initially compiled on campus using a Linux command prompt after Xming had been run. If Xming is installed on your computer, you should be able to run the project by using the a.out file included.

This was our first group project and, at the time, we had no knowledge on AI programming, so the computer will always move in a predetermined (hard-coded) pattern. There is also a bug which allows the player to make certain illegal moves.
